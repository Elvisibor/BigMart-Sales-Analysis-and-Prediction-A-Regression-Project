# BigMart-Sales-Analysis-and-Prediction-A-Regression-Project

# Context
In today's modern world, huge shopping centers such as big malls and marts are recording data related to sales of items or products as an important step to predict the sales and get an idea about future demands that can help with inventory management. Understanding what role certain properties of an item play and how they affect their sales is imperative to any retail business

In this project, we are working with sales data collected by BigMart7s Data Scientist for 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. Using this data, BigMart is trying to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

# Objective
To build a predictive model that can find out the sales of each product at a particular store and then provide actionable recommendations to the BigMart sales team to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.
